Notes and observations:

I predict that the random forest will perform better than the random forest classifier before scaling.Based on the testing scores on our 2 models before scaling, we can see that the random forest classifier model performed better with a score of 0.63 compared to the logistic regression model that had a score of 0.5

- After scaling, the logistic regression model performed better than the random forest classifier model with a score of 0.75, showing an increase to its score prior scaling of 0.5. This shows that the logistic regression model is more sensitive to scaling than the random forest classifier model.
